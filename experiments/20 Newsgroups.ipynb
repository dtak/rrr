    "As in the previous section, we see a fair amount of overlap between LIME and the in-example input gradients, though the top-weighted words aren't exactly the same.  \"In-example\" just means we've limited the input gradients to words that appear in the document; i.e., they tell us that the presence of words in the input were positive or negative predictors of the predicted class. Words that show up in the \"all components\" gradients are words that may not exist in the document at all, but would increase or decrease the probability of the predicted class if added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that this method produces very similar results to LIME despite the different perturbation methods -- LIME selectively masks words then fits a linear model, while input gradients measure the effect of infinitesimal changes -- is pretty cool. And as we see above, it's much faster (and could be even faster with a more performant implementation).\n",

    "Let's see what happens when we apply this technique. 20 Newsgroups is a very \"messy\" dataset, and there are many differences in the distributions of words between classes, so we shouldn't expect accuracy to fall off a cliff."

    "So, this is kind of interesting. Train accuracy remains pretty high initially but slowly tails off, whereas test accuracy wobbles around. These results aren't completely consistent across retrains; sometimes test accuracy remains high for more interations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the actual explanations though, you can see that after each iteration, the words considered most predictive change pretty significantly, but in each case they still make intuitive sense. Also, the fact that test accuracy sometimes increases later into the find-another-explanation iterations suggests that there are important features we miss in the first iteration. One idea could be to run find-another-explanation on a subset of the training set, test against the rest (as a validation set), then use that to generate a set of annotations $A$ we think might generalize better -- though maybe the problem is more fundamental, and had we included the validation set in the initial training process, we would have gotten a similar model anyway."
